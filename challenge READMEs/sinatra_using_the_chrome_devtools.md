# Sinatra: Using the Chrome DevTools

[Back to the Challenge Map](README.md)

Our app now expects users to visit one page - found at the `/cat-form` path - and submit a form which takes them to another - the `/named-cat` path.

In this challenge, you will use the **Chrome DevTools** to observe the flow of requests and responses between your client and the server.

### Learning Objectives covered
- Use the Chrome DevTools to investigate network requests

### To complete this challenge, you will need to:

- [ ] Open the Chrome DevTools within your browser
- [ ] Switch to the Network pane of the DevTools
- [ ] Interact with your application, explaining to your pair partner what is happening in the DevTools when you do so
- [ ] Locate the method for each request
- [ ] Locate the form data for `POST` requests
