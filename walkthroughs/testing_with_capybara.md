# Testing with Capybara

### Setup

As instructed on the [Capybara Workout site](https://capybaraworkout.herokuapp.com/),
create a Gemfile listing the following dependencies:

```ruby
source "https://rubygems.org"
gem 'capybara'
gem 'selenium-webdriver'
```

Then run the commands as instructed, in IRB. What this will do is start an instance
of the "headed" browser with which we can play with Capybara commands.
