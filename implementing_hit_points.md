# Implementing Hit Points

[Back to the Challenge Map](README.md)

We have just refactored our code, separating our Controller layer from our Model layer. This refactor will make it easier to approach our next User Story:

```
As Player 1,
So I can start to win a game of Battle,
I want my attack to reduce Player 2's HP by 10
```

In this challenge, you will implement a feature that meets this User Story. You should make only minimal changes in views or in the controller: almost all the changes required to solve this can happen in the Model.

### Learning Objectives covered
- Write a feature test using Capybara
- Pass a feature test using Capybara
- Implement a feature from the Model layer

### To complete this challenge, you will need to:

- [ ] Write a feature test for the User Story above
- [ ] Pass this test with minimal implementation.
