# Single Responsibility Principle, anyone?

[Back to the Challenge Map](README.md)

We just implemented a User Story almost entirely from the Model layer. Before we proceed to the next one, let's make sure our Model is following OOD best practices.

At current, our `Player` model is responsible for two main things: managing its hit points, and attacking other players.

In this challenge, you will extract a model capable of performing attacks from the `Player` model, without breaking any feature tests.

### Learning Objectives covered
- Refactor the model layer

### To complete this challenge, you will need to:

- [ ] Extract the `#attack` method (and associated tests) into a `Game` class
- [ ] Refactor your controller so it uses a `Game` instance to make an attack.
