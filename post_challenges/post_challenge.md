# Post-Challenge 1: Extending Battle

[Back to the Challenge Map](../README.md)

Welcome to the Post-Challenges! Now you must decide whether to:

- Go back, and reinforce processes and concepts that are shaky, or
- Continue forward, and extend our current domain in new ways.

If you wish to do the latter, here are the 'Extension' User Stories:

```
As a Player,
So I can play a suspenseful game of Battle,
I want all Attacks to deal a random amount of damage

As a lonely Player,
So I can keep my Battle skills up to scratch
I want to play a Computerised opponent

As a Player,
So I can enjoy a game of Battle with more variety,
I want to choose from a range of attacks I could make

As a Player,
So I can better enjoy a game of Battle,
I want some of my attacks to Paralyse an opponent (chance of losing their next attack)

As a Player,
So I can better enjoy a game of Battle,
I want one of my attacks to have a chance of Poisoning my Opponent (Opponent takes a small random amount of damage at the beginning of their turn)

As a Player,
So I can better enjoy a game of Battle,
I want to make an attack that has a chance of sending my Opponent to Sleep (Opponent definitely misses next turn)

As a Player,
So I can extend my joyous experience of Battle,
I want to have an attack that heals some of my Hit Points

As a Player,
So I can enjoy my game of Battle,
I want a sexy user interface
```

You have met all the concepts required to implement these User Stories, but they are tricky to get right. Focus heavily on code quality, including:

- Great OOD design (especially in the model)
- Skinny controllers
- Full Test-Driven Development using Capybara
